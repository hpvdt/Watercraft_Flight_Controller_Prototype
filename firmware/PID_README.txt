The following file outlines the tuning gains that correspond to a 
critically damped, underdamped, and overdamped system given an 
overall system gain ("K") of 0.5

Critically Damped:
    Kp = 1
    Ki = 1
    Kd = 0
    
Overdamped:
    Kp = 0.5
    Ki = 1
    Kd = 0
    
Underdamped:
    Kp = 2.5
    Ki = 2.5
    Kd = 0
